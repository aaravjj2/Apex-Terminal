# Apex Terminal 2-Year Weekly Plan - Block 4 (Weeks 40-52)

**Time Window:** Weeks 40-52
**Block Theme:** AI Autopilot and strategy OS
**Block Objective:** Achieve Bloomberg-style workflow depth while preserving deterministic quality and operational safety.

## Block-Wide Non-Negotiables
- More than 100,000 self-tested LOC delivered each week.
- At least 3,500 tests touched per week across unit, integration, contract, e2e, perf, and chaos.
- 95+ percent changed-line coverage and full critical-path regression before release promotion.
- Daily canary and weekly production promotion with rollback proof.
